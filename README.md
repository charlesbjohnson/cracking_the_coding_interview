#cracking_the_coding_interview

My collection of solutions to the exercises from the book
[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. Implemented in Ruby and accompanied by a Minitest test
suite.

This is also a container repo for any CS type problems I think are interesting.
Examples include data structures, algorithms, and whatever else I can find.

Chapters are broken down as follows:

* 1 - Arrays and Strings
* 2 - Linked Lists
* 3 - Stacks and Queues
* 4 - Trees and Graphs
* 5 - Bit Manipulation
* 6 - Brain Teasers
* 7 - Mathematics and Probability
* 8 - Object-Oriented Design
* 9 - Recursion and Dynamic Programming
* 10 - Scalability and Memory Limits
* 11 - Sorting and Searching

Thank you to Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne for the awesome lectures on
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) that significantly sped
up the time it took to refresh on some of this stuff.
